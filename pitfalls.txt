Setup:
I tried to create the server client setup by installing and connecting a local server (tomcat) instead of just using
Java

HTTP-Request Tries:
    Wrote GET inside the reqeust wrong (Get) -> 400 Bad Request

ServerSocket closing:
    Closing either the BufferedWriter or the BufferedReader, closes the SocketConnection as well. So the Socket can't
    be used anymore.
