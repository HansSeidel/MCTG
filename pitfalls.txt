Setup:
I tried to create the server client setup by installing and connecting a local server (tomcat) instead of just using
Java

HTTP-Request Tries:
    Wrote GET inside the reqeust wrong (Get) -> 400 Bad Request

BufferWriter:
    BufferedWriter does not fit the correct formats so it response in TimeOutException. PrintWriter does.
    Looking closely at the using of newLine(), the BufferedWriter works too.
